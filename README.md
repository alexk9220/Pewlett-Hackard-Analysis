# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis
Having used SQL Postgre to analyze the data we've been given, we are now ready to prodive some insights regarding the fututre of Pewlett-Hackard and its human capital as quite a considerable amount of empoyees are nearing their retirement age. Some recommendations will be given for the management based on our findings.

# Results

## *Overall a great amount of people are retiring soon

Given the size of the company and the amount of people employed it's not surprising that people retire in great amounts. For any company of such scale it's hardly an abnormality  - it's neither unexpected nor alarming in any way, with the amount of people Pewlett-Hackard employs, preparing new hires and/or promoting current employees to replace those leaving soon should not be an issue. 


## *There are only 9 managers, 1 per department

Despite having 300024 employees there are only 9 departments and 9 people who officially hold manager titles in the company. 



## *There are two managers retiring soon

There are only nine departments in the company so 2 managers consititute 22% of the entire management staff. While not really concerning, this fact should not be overlooked - given the size of the company it's not supposed to be problematic to find and/or prepare the two new managers needed to step in after the current ones retire. While it's really hard to say how many senior engineer or even assistant engineer roles need to be filled due to the fact that we don't have enough data, we most definitely need to fill in the 2 manager positions that are going to be vacant soon.

## *1940 are eligible to be mentors

A total number of 1940 people are available to potentially mentor the new generation of Pewlett-Hackarders. Having scrolled through the mentorship eligibility output it's safe to say that there is no evident shortage of potential mentors for any specific role - based on my obesrvations roles are spread somewhat evenly across the total amount of those employees who meet our mentorship criteria (the only exception would me managers).

# Summary

A total number of 90398 people will soon depart based on the data obtained, thus making their current positions vacant in foreseeable future. We do have a decent amount of people available to mentor new employees, however it all depends on when exactly they decide to retire, how much training will be required for those replacing, etc. - a lot of different factors to consider. 

## *There are more men employed at PH than women

<img width="134" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-09 at 10 19 12 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73204192/101649074-7b6fb580-3a08-11eb-97d5-c63548ed8949.png">

60% of people employed at PH are men, thus 40% of emplyees are women. This information might come in handy and be useful for our HR department - for instance it might help us change our hiring practices, it might help us change our health benefits plan, etc. - there are lots and lots of possible options. Also we can see that there are only two gender designations - M for men and F for women, given the fact that our societies have been rapidly evolving in the pas few years, we might need to add a few more gender options to improve our HR specific operations.
The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
