Given the size of the company and the amount of people employed it's not surprising that people retire in great amounts. For any company of such scale it's hardly an abnormality  - it's neither unexpected nor alarming in any way, with the amount of people Pewlett-Hackard employs, preparing new hires and/or promoting current employees to replace those leaving soon should not be an issue. 

## *There are two managers retiring soon

There are only nine departments in the company so 2 managers consititute 22% of the entire management staff. While not really concerning, this fact should not be overlooked - given the size of the company it's not supposed to be problematic to find and/or prepare the new managers to step in after the current ones retire. While it's really hard to say how many senior engineer or even assistant engineer roles need to be filled due to the fact that we don't have enough data, we most definitely need to fill in the 2 manager positions that are going to be vacant soon.


## *There are more men employed at PH than women

60% of people employed at PH are men, thus 40% of emplyees are women. This information might come in handy and be useful for our HR department - for instance it might help us change our hiring practices, it might help us change our health benefits plan, etc. - there are lots and lots of possible options. Also we can see that there are only two gender designations - M for men and F for women, given the fact that our societies have been rapidly evolving in the pas few years, we might need to add a few more gender options to improve our HR specific operations.
